## MVP (5 bullets)

1. Users can register/login/logout

2. Users can create, view, update, delete todos

3. Users can mark todos complete/incomplete

4. Users can filter todos: all / completed / pending

5. API endpoints exist for todos with Swagger/OpenAPI docs

## UI choice

* Bootstrap 5 via CDN (fastest)

* Interactivity: SSR only (for now). (Later you can add HTMX easily)
